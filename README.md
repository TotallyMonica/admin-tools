# TotallyMonica's Admin Tools
All of these files are deliberately written with command prompt and/or AutoHotKey for IT admins to tweak this to their liking with ease. 
Current Features:
 - Very rudementary tech support scam prevention
 - Very basic multi-user deployment
 
 To-do list:
 - Get the anti-scam deployment tool out of alpha
 - Update add_user.bat to be more friendly for multi user deployments
 - Be able to provide your own password for add_user.bat
 - Be able to randomly generate a password for add_user.bat
 - Work more on anti-scam-deployment.bat to be a one-trick pony and not require so many files to be present (ahk script?)
 - Make the fake cmd.exe the first option that comes up when you use the windows search bar
 - Add macOS and Linux varients for each script here
 - Add the ability to map network drives
 - Windows KMS activation script
